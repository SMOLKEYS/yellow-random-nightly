---- YELLOW NIGHTLY BUILDS ----

Nothing here is consistent. Take note of that.
Because I no longer have access to GitHub Actions, builds appear here when I decide to add one.

Formatting: [PLATFORM]-YYYY-MM-DD-[INDEX]_[BRANCH]
Nightly builds may also use this formatting for the in-game version.

PLATFORM can be ANDROID, PC or ANY.
INDEX goes up when multiple builds appear within one day.
BRANCH is.... yeah.

Integration to the mod might be considered.

- In-game downloading []
- Automatic platform detection []

---- THAT IS ALL ----
